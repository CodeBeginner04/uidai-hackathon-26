📊 Aadhaar Enrolment Data Analysis (India)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Aadhaar enrolment data across different Indian states and districts to understand demographic trends and enrolment patterns. The analysis is performed using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights by performing data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization across states, districts, and age groups.

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains Aadhaar enrolment statistics with the following key attributes:

Date – Enrolment date

State – Indian state name

District – District name

Pincode – Area pincode

Age_0_5 – Enrolments for age group 0–5

Age_5_17 – Enrolments for age group 5–17

Age_18_greater – Enrolments for age group 18+

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code Notebook

🔍 Analysis Performed

Cleaned raw data by handling missing values and converting data types

Filtered and analyzed data state-wise and district-wise

Aggregated Aadhaar enrolment numbers by age groups

Identified top districts by enrolment

Visualized insights using:

Bar charts (district-wise enrolment)

Heatmaps (age-group vs district analysis)

Trend plots (date-wise enrolment)
